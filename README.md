Amateur made Powershell scripts

02032020

Powershell Script that pings a host indefinitely by IP or by name until it responds. Once it responds, it opens a Chrome Tab to browse it.
E.g. An internet Circuit is down for one of your customers and you set it to ping the IP assigned to that circuit.
Once it starts responding to pings, it will open a Chrome Tab with the IP.
From there you can login into the firewall, vpn, servers or check other resources.
